          <p>Zina Kumok | October 9, 2020</p>
          <br />
          <div class="block"><img class="is-5by3 mb-1" src="images/katie-harp-QqAkoMIN5Jk-unsplash.jpg" alt=""></div>
      
          <div class="column has-text-left is-10 is-offset-1">
            <p>People tend to latch on to the wisdom of the most prominent experts in any field. In the case of personal 
              finance, the most famous expert is probably Dave Ramsey. One of his key pieces of advice is to save $1,000 in 
              an emergency fund before paying off any high-interest debt.</p>
            <br />
            <p>That&rsquo;s good advice, but some people end up taking it the wrong way. They assume that $1,000 is the most 
              they need to save, rather than a baseline. For some people, that might be enough &ndash; for others, it&rsquo;s not 
              even close.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The amount you need depends entirely on your personal circumstances. Here are some examples of when $1,000 is 
              adequate, when it falls short, and how to make the best use of what you have.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="is-size-4">When $1,000 Is Enough</h3>
            <p>Many experts recommend saving three months&rsquo; worth of expenses in their emergency fund, but not everyone 
              can afford that. For people who have high credit card debt or low incomes, $1,000 might be all they can save 
              without compromising other priorities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That amount is enough to cover most emergencies, like a sudden repair on your car, a trip to urgent care or 
              an emergency vet visit. $1,000 will probably cover the bill in each of those cases, and possibly with some money 
              left over.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When it comes to saving for an emergency, the goal should be to minimize the long-term damage an unexpected 
              expense can inflict on your finances. Even a small emergency fund will save you from the worst-case emergency 
              scenarios &ndash; borrowing money from friends or family, taking out a payday loan or pawning off an important 
              possession.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="is-size-4">When $1,000 Isn&rsquo;t Enough</h3>
            <p>If you have kids, are the sole provider of your family, are self-employed or own a home, $1,000 probably 
              isn&rsquo;t going to cut it. As anyone with a mortgage knows, the water heater doesn&rsquo;t care how much you 
              have in your emergency fund when it decides to break.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Self-employed people need more than $1,000 in an emergency fund because their business income can be sporadic 
              and inconsistent. Having an insufficient amount saved can mean taking on jobs that don&rsquo;t align with your 
              business, or even being forced back into a traditional job to make ends meet.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Similarly, if you work on commission and your salary depends on how many sales you make, $1,000 might be 
              inadequate. Any time you have inconsistent or variable income, you need to try for three to six month&rsquo;s 
              worth of expenses.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Parents should also try to have a more robust savings account. When you have other people relying on your income, 
              the potential for an emergency expense increases substantially. You don&rsquo;t want to be stuck choosing between 
              paying a medical bill and putting food on the table.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you have pets, especially those who are older or have chronic health problems, I&rsquo;d recommend having at 
              $2000-$3000 in your emergency fund. Some vet offices only accept cash and require payment before performing an 
              operation, so easily-accessible funds are a must.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I was paying off my student loans, the first thing I did was save up three months worth of expenses in an 
              emergency fund. I was a newspaper reporter and knew that the industry was volatile. Layoffs can happen at any time, 
              and I wanted to be prepared for that possibility.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As much as I wanted to chip away at my loan balance, I knew doing so without a solid financial foundation was just 
              asking for trouble. I didn&rsquo;t want to borrow money from my parents or take on even more debt if my career took 
              a downturn.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once I decided to pay off my student loans in three years, I was tempted to put my emergency fund toward that goal. 
              But as appealing as that was, I&rsquo;m glad I resisted the temptation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re paying off a lot of debt and still have extenuating circumstances, like kids or an unstable job, 
              don&rsquo;t raid your emergency fund to reach the finish line faster. Reaching your financial goals is like climbing 
              a mountain, and an emergency fund is like your first aid kit. Sure, you may not need it &ndash; but do you really want 
              to take that chance?</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="is-size-4">How to Stretch Your Emergency Fund</h3>
            <p>If you only have $1,000 and suffer a significant emergency, like job loss or emergency surgery, &nbsp;there are a 
              few basic strategies you can employ. For those with federal student loans, you can call and put your loans in deferment 
              or forbearance until you get settled.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can also switch to an income-based repayment plan, which could reduce your payments to $0. If you have private 
              student loans, call the provider and ask what your options are.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Utility companies sometimes provide emergency assistance if you call and ask. Even landlords can be understanding 
              about delaying rent in times of crisis. Make sure to call and ask before you miss a payment. That will show you&rsquo;re 
              trying to be responsible and considerate.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="is-size-4">Where to Store your Emergency Fund</h3>
            <p>The whole point of an emergency fund is ease of access. Whether you have $500 or $5,000 in your savings, you should 
              keep your emergency fund in the same place.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Most experts recommend using a savings account separate from your checking account. That way you won&rsquo;t be tempted 
              to spend the money on day-to-day items or splurges. A savings account is liquid enough for easy access during times of 
              need, and is also FDIC-insured so the funds won&rsquo;t lose any principal. If you shop around, you can find a savings 
              account that offers 2% interest.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some people hate the idea of letting their emergency fund languish in a savings account, where it might earn a paltry 
              $20 for the whole year, but that&rsquo;s the price you pay for accessibility and stability. If you invest those funds 
              in the stock market, you could risk losing the money when you need it most.</p>
            <br>
            <p>CDs or bonds are also not the right place for your emergency fund. Most of those require that you keep your money 
              locked up for a certain amount of time. An emergency fund needs to be accessed within a few days without paying extra 
              penalties.</p>
